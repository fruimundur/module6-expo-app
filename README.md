For this project I followed this tutorial, which was recommended in the guide: https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/

I wouldn't have been able to build this app myself, at least not in this short time frame, but it was a great introduction to React Native and Expo. It showed me the possibilites it has, and what the process of developing an app is like. 
Would highly recommend going through the tutorial.
